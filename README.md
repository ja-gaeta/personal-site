# Personal Site Example

## Project of a personal site, using Gatsby and Strap as Headless CMS.

This project was part of my training in the Gatsby Tutorial and Projects Course at Udemy.

**Note**:

On Unix Systems, processes in parallel should be:

```json
"start": "npm run server & npm run develop",

"build": "npm run server & npm run setup"
```
